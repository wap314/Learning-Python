    "In the early part of the 20th century, *__Ronald Fisher developed an approach to\n",
    "statistical hypothesis testing that has become the most commonly used approach\n",
    "for evaluating the probability of an observed effect having occurred purely by\n",
    "chance__*. Fisher claims to have invented the method in response to a claim by Dr.\n",
    "Muriel Bristol-Roach that when she drank tea with milk in it she could detect\n",
    "whether the tea or the milk was poured into the teacup first. Fisher challenged\n",
    "her to a “tea test” in which she was given eight cups of tea (four for each order of\n",
    "adding tea and milk), and asked to identify those cups into which the tea had\n",
    "been poured before the milk. She did this perfectly. Fisher then calculated the\n",
    "probability of her having done this purely by chance. As we saw in Section 15.4.4,\n",
    "$ {8 \\choose 4} = 70 $, i.e., *__there are 70\tdifferent ways to choose 4 cups out of 8. Since only one\n",
    "of these 70 combinations includes all 4 cups in which the tea was poured first,\n",
    "Fisher calculated that the probability of Dr. Bristol-Roach having chosen correctly by pure luck was $\\frac{1}{70} \\approx 0.014$. From this he concluded that it was highly unlikely\n",
    "that her success could be attributed to luck__*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*__Fisher’s approach to significance testing__* can be summarized as\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *__State a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis__*. The null hypothesis is\n",
    "that the “treatment” has no interesting effect. For the “tea test,” the null hypothesis was that Dr. Bristol-Roach had no ability to taste the difference. The\n",
    "alternative hypothesis is a hypothesis that can be true only if the null hypothesis is false, e.g., that Dr. Bristol-Roach could taste the difference. Actually, in his formulation, Fisher had only a null hypothesis. The idea of an alternative hypothesis was introduced later by Jerzey Newman and Egon Pearson.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *__Understand statistical assumptions about the sample being evaluated__*. For the\n",
    "“tea test” Fisher assumed that Dr. Bristol-Roach was making independent\n",
    "decisions for each cup.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *__Compute a relevant test statistic__*. In this case, the test statistic was the fraction of correct answers given by Dr. Bristol-Roach.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *__Derive the probability of that test statistic under the null hypothesis__*. In this\n",
    "case, the probability of getting all of the cups right by accident, i.e., 0.014.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *__Decide whether that probability is sufficiently small that you are willing to\n",
    "assume that the null hypothesis is false, i.e., to reject the null hypothesis__*.\n",
    "Common values for the rejection level, which should be chosen in advance,\n",
    "are 0.05 and 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to our cyclists, imagine that the times for the treatment and control groups were samples drawn from infinite populations of finishing times for\n",
    "PED-X users and PED-Y users. *__The null hypothesis for this experiment is that\n",
    "the means of those two larger populations are the same, i.e., the difference between the population mean of the treatment group and the population mean of\n",
    "the control group is 0. The alternative hypothesis is that they are not the same,\n",
    "i.e., the difference in means is not equal to 0.__*\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we go about trying to reject the null hypothesis. *__We choose a threshold,\n",
    "α, for statistical significance, and try to show that the probability of the data having been drawn from distributions consistent with the null hypothesis is less than\n",
    "α. We then say that we can reject the null hypothesis with confidence α, and accept the negation of the null hypothesis with probability 1\t– α.__*\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of α affects the kind of errors we make. *__The larger α, the more often we will reject a null hypothesis that is actually true. These are known as type I\n",
    "errors. When α is smaller, we will more often accept a null hypothesis that is actually false. These are known as type II errors.__*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most commonly, people choose α = 0.05. However, depending upon the consequences of being wrong, it might be preferable to choose a smaller or larger α.\n",
    "Imagine, for example, that the null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the\n",
    "rate of premature death between those taking PED-X and those taking PED-Y.\n",
    "One might well want to choose a small α, say 0.01, as the basis for rejecting that\n",
    "hypothesis before deciding whether or not one drug was safer than the other. On\n",
    "the other hand, if the null hypothesis were that there is no difference in the taste\n",
    "of PED-X and PED-Y, one might comfortably choose a pretty large α.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to compute the test statistic. *__The most common test statistic\n",
    "is the t-statistic. The t-statistic tells us how different, measured in units of standard error, the estimate derived from the data is from the null hypothesis. The\n",
    "larger the t-statistic, the more likely the null hypothesis can be rejected__*. For our\n",
    "example, the t-statistic tells us how many standard errors the difference in the\n",
    "two means (118.79 – 120.17 =\t-1.38) is from 0. *__The t-statistic for our PED-X example is -2.13165598142. What does this mean? How do we use it?__*\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the t-statistic in much the same way we use the number of standard\n",
    "deviations from the mean to compute confidence intervals (see Section 15.4.2).\n",
    "Recall that for all normal distributions the probability of an example lying within\n",
    "a fixed number of standard deviations of the mean is fixed. Here we do something slightly more complex that *__takes into account the number of samples used\n",
    "to compute the standard error. Instead of assuming a normal distribution, we assume a t-distribution__*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*__T-distributions were first described, in 1908, by William Gosset, a statistician\n",
    "working for the Arthur Guinness and Son brewery__*. Guiness forbade Gosset from publishing under his own name. He used the pseudonym\n",
    "“Student” when he published his seminal 1908 paper, “Probable Error of a Mean,” about t-distributions. As a result, the distribution is frequently called “Student’s t-distribution.”\n",
    "*__The t-distribution is actually a family of distributions, since the shape of the distribution depends upon the degrees of freedom in the sample__*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*__The degrees of freedom describes the amount of independent information\n",
    "used to derive the t-statistic.__* In general, we can think of degrees of freedom as the\n",
    "number of independent observations in a sample that are available to estimate\n",
    "some statistic about the population from which that sample is drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "*__A t-distribution looks a lot like a normal distribution, and the larger the degrees of freedom the closer it is to a normal distribution__*. For small degrees of\n",
    "freedom, the t-distributions have notably fatter tails than normal distributions.\n",
    "For degrees of freedom of 30 or more, t-distributions are very close to normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's use the sample variance to estimate the population variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\text{variance} = \\frac{\\sum_{x \\in X} (x-\\mu)^2}{|X|} $\n",
    "\n",
    "so the variance of our sample is \n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{(100-200)^2 + (200-200)^2 + (300-200)^2}{3} $\n",
    "\n",
    "*__It might appear that we are using three independent pieces of information,\n",
    "but we are not__*. The three terms in the numerator are not independent of each\n",
    "other, because all three observations were used to compute the mean of the sample of 200 riders. *__The degrees of freedom is 2, since once we know the mean and\n",
    "any two of the three observations, the value of the third observation is fixed.__*\n",
    "\n",
    "*__The larger the degrees of freedom, the higher the probability that the sample\n",
    "statistic is representative of the population. The degrees of freedom in a t-statistic\n",
    "computed from a single sample is one less than the sample size, because the mean\n",
    "of the sample is used in calculating the t-statistic__*. If two samples are used, the degrees of freedom is two less than the sum of the sample sizes, because the mean\n",
    "of each sample is used in calculating the t-statistic. For example, for the PEDX/PED-Y experiment, the degrees of freedom is 198.\n",
    "\n",
    "*__Given the degrees of freedom, we can draw a plot showing the appropriate t-distribution, and then see where the t-statistic we have computed for our PED-X\n",

    "the plot in Figure 19.4. The code first uses the function scipy.random.standard_t\n",
